** CHARACTERS **

 Lieutenant Reed:
 The second-in-command of the Quincy Experimental Weapons Corp. He moves at average speed, has an average size hitbox, has very fast stamina loss, and very slow stamina recovery. His shields are very weak, but last a long time. They have average recovery. He fires very high-damage bullets with a narrow spray effect. His charge attack fires four lines of electricity in front of him.

 Dragonfly:
 A youkai who controls dragonflies. She moves slowly and has a large hitbox, but has fast stamina recovery. Her shields are weak, expensive, and don't last very long, but recover quickly. She fires very quickly. She summons dragonflies, which fly randomly across the field, very quickly, and have low damage. Her charge attack sends a large swarm of dragonflies out across the field.

 Ormrinn:
 An expert assassin known for his brutal methods. He is fast, has average stamina loss and recovery, and an average sized hitbox. His shields are very strong and cheap, but have a very short duration and slow recovery. He throws knives in combat, which are difficult to aim with, but can deal very high damage if used properly. His charge attack sends six spirals of knives spinning out from him.

 Karex:
 A young air magician. She moves at average seed, has a small hitbox, has average stamina loss and recovery. Her shields have very high health, but average duration, cost, and recovery. She fires very slowly. Her bullets are slow, but are guided and very powerful. Her charge attack fires a large mass of guided bullets.

 Lerea:
 Apprentice to the Mad Hermit. She moves at average speed, has an average size hitbox, and average stamina loss and recovery. Her shields have average health, and average duration, cost, and recovery. She fires very quickly. Her bullets are fast, weak, and have a narrow spray effect. Her charge attack fires six very large, slow, very high-damage projectiles.

** KNOWN BUGS **

 * Monsters will sometimes leave the screen.
 This is really a problem with my movement AIs--The easiest way to fix it is to code them so that they change direction if they leave the screen. Also, although it has never happened, if a boss were to wander 504 pixels off-screen in any direction, it would be automatically killed, without its death hooks being triggered, so that the player would be stuck in that stage forever. This is high priority, and should be fixed soon.

 * The framerate isn't consistent.
 Unfortunately, with a curtain shooter game, this is unavoidable. I recommend not running anything particularly strenous while playing (iTunes and Azureus are particularly bad) if you have serious trouble with this. Also, I will eventually implement a little framerate counter, which, although it won't fix the problem, will at least make it look like it's under control.

 ** CREDITS **

All coding, art, etc were done by me, that is, Skizzaltix (sce.inkwash.net). However, the game itself is a knockoff of Team Shanghai Alice's Touhou Project (Also known as Project Shrine Maiden), and, as such, almost all credit for game concepts goes to ZUN, the sole member of Team Shanghai Alice.
Also, credit for a few other game concepts and motivation, as well as making me start the whole thing, goes to Yuuei (apm.inkwash.net).
